# straight-wrist

This is the program run by a device that monitors wrist posture using flex sensors and provides real-time haptic feedback via vibration motors. The system detects flexion/extension, triggering adjustable vibrations when deviations exceed customizable thresholds. The hardware integrates analog flex sensors and vibration motors with an Arduino microcontroller.
